# CS104-03

I will include resources here that might be of use to the UAH CS community at this course. Feel free to make a PR (pull request) if you have any specific suggestions or things you think should be added.

>For peeps who've never coded before, but who'd like to, you might like a guide like this in addition to our content internal to Canvas.

>To help us develop a high level understanding of the major components of a modern computer system I‚Äôve linked this video. It‚Äôs very conceptual; @Professor_Beth ‚Äòs resources  at canvas are more concrete. Both are useful angles. While watching the Feynman lecture, you may wish to ask yourself which actual physical components correspond to each of Feynman‚Äôs metaphors. For instance, what are the physical equivalents of the ‚Äúcards‚Äù that Feynman describes, and what hardware is used to ‚Äúfile‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúprocess‚Äù these cards?

If you enjoyed the Feynman lecture at ‚Å†general, you may be excited to know that he taught an entire introductory course on computation available in book form as Feynman Lectures on Computation (https://smile.amazon.com/Feynman-Lectures-Computation-Richard-P/dp/0738202967). There are several other books that provide a good high-level introduction: a popular one is Code by Charles Petzold (https://smile.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319/), another is But How Do It Know by J Clark Scott (https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers/dp/0615303765).

would strongly recommend turing complete; if only for a fun thing to do when you've completed all your academic responsibilities.

>general programming practice
If you've finished Program1; it may or may not be a good idea to work at some practice problems here until we're assigned another project. Might give us something fun to work on interim if you've got no other academic responsibilities.

if you're not proficient at typing in general; it might or might not benefit you to spend 15 minutes here daily at the Python implementation

>If anyone is curious about floats as referenced at Prof Beth's lecture at Module 3; you may be interested at this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZRI1IfStY0

Furthermore, "What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic" is a classic and stunningly detailed paper covering the many rough edges and surprising behaviors of the standard.

>For just a glimpse of what the future of computing may resemble, see this talk at Google I/O 2018 by John Hennessy. Again, please only consider spending your time at content at ‚Å†off-topic if you've finished your academic responsibilities. The content here; while admittedly super cool, is not actually programming practice, and as you know Prof Beth mentioned this is non-trivial if we expect to refine our skills.

Cool video from M. Louis Salmon Library.

>This is another cool talk that discusses the history of computer architecture, and makes some predictions for the future. Again, it's probably a bad idea to spend time here at ‚Å†off-topic if you haven't completed your academic responsibilities at CS104-03. Solving actual problems and formulating your own unique implementations to these is, like Prof Beth mentioned at Module 3's lecture series is the only way to refine our skills. But taking breaks between p-sets here at ‚Å†off-topic might be a nice palate cleanser before jumping back into actual programming.
